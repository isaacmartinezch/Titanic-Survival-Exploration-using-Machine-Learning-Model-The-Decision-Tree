# Titanic-Survival-Exploration-using-Machine-Learning-Model-the-Decision-Tree
In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this introductory project, I will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, i will need to implement several conditional predictions and answer the questions below.
